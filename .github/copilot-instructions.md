# Instructions for Gemini

- **CRITICAL RULE:** Do not, under any circumstances, modify any files within the `/src` directory. This code is deployed on a satellite currently in orbit and cannot be changed.
- **ALERT:** If you detect any modifications to files within the `/src` directory, you must immediately alert the user.
- **CONTEXT:** Future development for the ground station will be managed in a separate directory. Therefore, all code within `/src` should be treated as read-only.
